Change Log

0.9.0 (unreleased)
==================

This release contains the following **backwards incompatible** changes:

* Migrated from ``pytz`` to ``zoneinfo`` for ``TimeZoneField``/``TimeZoneHelper``.

In addition, it also contains:

* Added compatibility with Django versions 4.2 and 5.0
* Improved customisability of pagination template
* Updated ``UNDEFINED`` to ensure it cannot be deep copied (it will always be the same instance)
* Updated the ``Archivable.archive()`` method to raise ``ProtectedError`` and ``RestrictedError`` as ``delete()`` would, when inbound foreign keys using ``on_delete=models.PROTECT`` or ``on_delete=models.RESTRICT`` are detected against unarchived records
* Updated ``Loggable`` to support tagging individual log entries and subsequently filtering retrieved log entries

0.8.0 (2022-12-12)
==================

* Added compatibility with Django versions 4.0 and 4.1
* Dropped support for Django versions below 3.2
* Updated ``Auditable`` and ``Versionable`` to use ``self._state.adding`` to differentiate between records being added or updated
* Switched development environment from Vagrant to Docker

Note: As of this release, ``TimeZoneField``/``TimeZoneHelper`` still require ``pytz``, despite the Django 4.0+ move to ``zoneinfo``.

0.7.2 (2021-10-05)
==================

* Removed public ``djem.auth.get_user_log_verbosity()`` function due to the apparent potential for causing cyclic imports, as observed in real world usage.

0.7.1 (2021-08-25)
==================

* Fixed readthedocs configuration
* Fixed README badges

0.7 (2021-08-24)

* Renamed ``CommonInfoForm`` to ``AuditableForm``
* Renamed ``DJEM_COMMON_INFO_USER_REQUIRED_ON_SAVE`` setting to ``DJEM_AUDITABLE_USER_REQUIRED_ON_SAVE``
